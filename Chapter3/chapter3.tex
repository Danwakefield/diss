\chapter{Implementation} \label{sec:implementation}

%The implementation should look at any issues you encountered as you tried to implement your design. During the work, you might have found that elements of your design were unnecessary or overly complex; perhaps third party libraries were available that simplified some of the functions that you intended to implement. If things were easier in some areas, then how did you adapt your project to take account of your findings?

%It is more likely that things were more complex than you first thought. In particular, were there any problems or difficulties that you found during implementation that you had to address? Did such problems simply delay you or were they more significant? 

%You can conclude this section by reviewing the end of the implementation stage against the planned requirements.

\section{Circular References}
\label{sec:circular-refs}
Circular imports have been a problem during the project, see~\ref{sec:user-functions} and~\ref{sec:builtins}.
My experience with Go has never been with a project large enough to require subpackages and this was the main reason behind my lack of planning for them.
While it would have been possible to create everything in the main package this would have have left it quite crowded.
It is also had for a new person to understand what is important if things are not separated properly.
I experienced this while trying to learn from the source code of bash and dash.

A better design would have been to create a package each for the nodes, substitutions and the main lexer \& parser.
The only thing that would be in the main package would be the entrypoint function, in 'main.go', that sets up the run loop of parsing and evaluation.
