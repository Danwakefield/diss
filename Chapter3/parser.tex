\section{Main Parser, AST \& Nodes}
The parser turns the tokens into nodes and constructs AST's with them.
It was developed iteratively as other elements of the code where completed. XXX

\subsection{Simple Command}
A simple command is a line that contains a command with optional arguments and variable assignments.
The command can be a builtin (See~\ref{sec:builtins}), a function (See~\ref{sec:user-functions}) or an external command.

If the line with assignments also has an external command call, the assignments are temporary and are removed when the command completes.

During the third iteration this was created to support commands with arguments.
It was expanded during the fourth to accommodate variables assignments and during the fifth, for arguments that contained substitutions.
The simple command function is also the place that function definitions are detected and this was added during the penultimate iteration.
